Network Topology Documentation

1. Overview
This topology represents a structured enterprise LAN segmented into departments — Servers, Marketing, and Engineering — all interconnected via a core switch. The network also integrates physical network access, an ArubaCX switch (management), and a wireless access point.

6. Connectivity Flow
1. All departmental switches connect to the Core Switch.
2. The Core Switch provides uplinks to:
   - Physical Network (for internet or external access).
   - Netprobe monitoring server.
3. Engineering Switch has direct uplinks to:
   - Access Point
   - ArubaCX switch (management port)
4. Servers Switch aggregates multiple servers: SRV-DC, SRV-APP, SRV-FILE.
5. Marketing Switch connects to a workstation and a printer.
